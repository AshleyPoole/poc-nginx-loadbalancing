# Features

In this chapter, I will list the main selling points of F5's solution.

##### Application Availability
F5 have two ways of doing high availability, Active/Standby and Active/Active. F5 don't, however, do true Active/Active; F5 have opted to split VIPs between hosts so only one node handles traffic for that VIP at once. 

##### Application Security
F5 have a dedicated WAF module you can purchase that allows a whole host of security features. Just focusing on the loadbalancer licencing F5 have a list of iRules you can use to direct traffic or block traffic. 

##### Application Optimisation
F5 have the standard file caching features that are in most load balancers. F5 also have the ability to use HTTP/2 and SPDY; these are protocols used for faster website requests.

##### Programmability
F5 have a few methods of configuration, the main two that are supported is a REST API and a PowerShell module. F5 also have integration with Puppet.

##### Management
F5 like other solutions has a GUI; they also have an API a CLI tool for management. F5 also has the concept of templates allowing tasks to be streamlined. Where F5 has a benefit over its competitors is the collection of community shared templates
