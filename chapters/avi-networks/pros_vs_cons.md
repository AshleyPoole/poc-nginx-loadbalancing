# Avi Pros vs. Cons


### Pros

- Avi have competitive pricing, with an extensive set unique of features.
- The analytics features are beyond anything I've seen before in a load balancer solution. I believe this would make debugging issues much easier.
- In Q1 2017 there will be a built-in WAF, this will be an extra layer of security for our applications; This additional feature will be free.
- Avi has integration with VMware to scale without human intervention and can be done within 30 seconds.
- Avi can demonstrate Active/Active meaning we could have our DR load balancer accept traffic.
- With Avi's REST API and tooling, we should be able to automate most (if not all) of the manual tasks we do on loadbalancer.org.

### Cons

- Avi is relatively new in the market compared to bigger competitive. They do however have big customers such as PayPal & Apple.
