# Features

In this chapter I will list the main selling points of Avi Networks distributed load balancer.

The Avi load balancer has 7 core categories, each with features that set them apart from other load balancer solutions.

##### Application Availability
In this category we tick off most of our requimrents for our load balancer soloution; health monitoring, session persistence, stand-in error page, weighted load balancing and high avalability. Where Avi shines in this category is the ability to scale horizontaly and autoscale.
