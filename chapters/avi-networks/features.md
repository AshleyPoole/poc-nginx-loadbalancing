# Features

In this chapter, I will list the main selling points of Avi Networks distributed load balancer.

The Avi load balancer has seven core categories, each with features that set them apart from other load balancer solutions.

##### Application Availability
In this category we tick off most of our requirements for our load balancer solution; health monitoring, session persistence, stand-in error page, weighted load balancing and high availability. Where Avi shines in this category is the ability to scale horizontally and autoscale, Avi integrates with vSphere so it can automatically scale with our traffic and downscale when needed, this feature also allows a load balancer to be rebuild in less than a minute if we have a failure. 

##### Application Security
Our only requirement from this section was SSL offloading, but Avi has a lot of extra features we would benefit from. Avi also can detect and prevent L3/L4/L7 DDoS attacks as well as block traffic. In Q1 of 2017 Avi will also have a build in WAF, this in combined with the ability to block IPs directly from the load balancer will make it a lot easier to mitigate attacks.

##### App Performance Monitoring
This category is where Avi shines. Avi is built around an analytics core; this core allows us to get live data of what pages are viewed, from where, on what device, time to connect to LB, time to get application response, etc. (screenshots below). With the ability to search all this data it would make it easy to find issues with application performance, as well as potential attacks. 

##### Application Optimisation
This category is short, Avi like many other load balancing solutions provide content caching so resources like images, javascript and CSS get sent from local cache vs. spending time on a trip to the web servers. Avi also gives the ability to resize images on the fly.
